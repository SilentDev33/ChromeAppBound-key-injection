## Chrome Injector

The modified original code from https://github.com/xaitax/Chrome-App-Bound-Encryption-Decryption, converted into a DLL format, with injector written in C++, allows us to retrieve the App Bound key from any directory and without administrator privileges

Build app_bound.cpp in visual studio as .dll x64 and ChromeInjector as .exe x64
